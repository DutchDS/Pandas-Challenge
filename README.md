#Week 4 Pandas Challenge
By A. Rijpkema on 11/2/2019

This week's challenge was rooted in getting to know Pandas and the use of Data Frames.

In pyCitySchools 2 datafiles (csv-files) are used to analyse the performance of the students in the areas of math and reading in 15 different schools within a certain district.

The excise starts with a summary on the district level. Adding up all school's data - total number of students, total budget spent, overall average math grade and overall average reading grade.

It then dives deeper into the data to summarize performance per school. The Top and Bottom five performing schools are displayed - based on their overall passing percentages.

Next, the average reading and math scores are split per grade level (9th-12th) for each school.

Lastly, the key figures (average math, reading scores, math/reading/overall passing rates) are summarized by 3 different categories:
* Budget spending bins
* School size
* Type of school

Conclusion:

Suprisingly, the lower the average budget per student, the higher the percentage of students that passs both Reading and Math. (passing = 70 or higher grade). Students in smaller schools (1000 students or less) AND medium schools (between 1000 and 2000 students) perform equally well on math and reading. Larger schools, however, perform considerably worse. With a total of 25% of students less passing Math compared to the small and medium sized schools. Charter Schools outperform District schools on both Reading and Math. Charter school's overall passing rate is over 21% points higher than District's school
